# JAVASCRIPT PLAYGROUND

### OVERVIEW

JavaScript Playground is a project boilerplate I created for small projects and
practicing test-driven development with Jest. It's also well-suited for
exploring ES6+ features in a realistic environment.

### THE PROJECT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET STARTED 🚀

- HTML5 🔥
- CSS3 via SCSS 🔥
- ES6+ via Babel 🔥
- Module Bundling via Webpack 🔥
- Live Reload via Webpack Dev Server 🔥
- Formatting via Prettier 🔥
- Linting via ESLint 🔥
- Type Checking via Flow 🔥
- Unit Testing via Jest 🔥

> ⚠️ Warning: The project uses husky and lint-staged to prevent you from
> committing code that doesn't pass validation (i.e. formatting, linting, and
> type checking).

### SETUP IS EASY 👇

If you want to use JavaScript Playground for a new project, then click the green **``Use
this template``** button above and follow the instructions to create a new repo
based on this one.

If you just want to review the code, then follow the steps below.

##### Step 1:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:georgebullock/javascript-playground.git
```

##### Step 2:

```bash
yarn install
```

##### Step 3:

```bash
yarn start
```

> ⚠️ Warning: **The project requires node v12.6.0**.

> 💡 Tip: If you're using nvm, you can
> run `nvm use` to automatically switch to v12.6.0.

> 💡 Tip: Check out the `scripts` object (inside the `package.json`) for
> additional commands.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

#### Project Motivation:

I was motivated to do this project for three reasons:

1. I needed a customized starting point for the type of small, learning,
   projects that are on my personal development roadmap.
2. I needed an environment where I can practice TDD with Jest.
3. I wanted to move away from repl.it and Codpen for playing with code. With
   JavaScript Playground, I can quickly spin up a familiar development
   environment and try things out without losing access to important features
   (e.g. Chrome debugger).

#### Project Status:

This project is semi-active. I don't plan to add any additional features, but I
will keep the project's dependencies up-to-date.

#### Project Roadmap:

No additional features planned.

#### Known Issues:

None that I'm aware of. If you find something, please create an issue or send me
a pull request.
