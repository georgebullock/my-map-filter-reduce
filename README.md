# MY MAP FILTER REDUCE

### OVERVIEW

My Map Filter Reduce is a micro-project that includes my own implementation's of
JavaScript's `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`,
`Array.prototype.reduce()`. Tests are provided via Jest.

### PROJECT STACK 🏢

I used
[JavaScript Playground](https://github.com/georgebullock/javascript-playground)
to scaffold the project. JavaScript playground includes the following
technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3 via SCSS
- ES6+ via Babel
- Module Bundling via Webpack
- Live Reload via Webpack Dev Server
- Formatting via Prettier
- Linting via ESLint
- Type Checking via Flow
- Unit Testing via Jest

I added no additional dependencies to My Map Filter Reduce.

### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS 👇

##### Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:georgebullock/my-map-filter-reduce.git
```

##### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

##### Step 3: Start the Project

```bash
yarn start
```

##### Step 4: Run the Test Suite

```bash
npm run t
```

> ⚠️ Warning: **The project requires node v12.6.0**.

> 💡 Tip: If you're using nvm, you can run `nvm use` to automatically switch to
> v12.6.0.

> 💡 Tip: Check out the `scripts` object (inside the `package.json`) for
> additional commands.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

#### Project Motivation:

I was motivated to do this project for four reasons:

1. I recently created
   [JavaScript Playground](https://github.com/georgebullock/javascript-playground)
   and wanted to test it out with a small project.
2. I was interview prepping and I read that writing implementations of commonly
   used methods is a common code challenge.
3. Despite being comfortable with `Array.map()` and `Array.filter()` - I never
   really understood how `Array.reduce()` worked until I wrote it myself and
   then used my implementation to mimic `Array.map()` and `Array.filter()`.
4. I'm interested in functional programming and this project was a good exercise
   in writing higher-order functions.

#### Project Status:

The project is finished.

#### Project Roadmap:

No additional features planned.

#### Known Issues:

None that I'm aware of. If you you find something, please create an issue or
send me a pull request.
